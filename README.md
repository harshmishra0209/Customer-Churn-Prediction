# Customer Churn Prediction

## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on **Customer Churn Prediction**, where the goal is to identify customers who are likely to stop using a company’s service. Predicting churn helps businesses take proactive steps to retain customers and improve overall revenue.

The project is implemented using **Python** and popular **Data Science & Machine Learning libraries**, and it is developed in a **Jupyter Notebook** for step-by-step analysis and model building.
